Hello, my name is Matt and I have been learning computer science for almost one year. \n
Some of my most recent projects consist of the utilization of Python and databases such as PostgreSQL. \n
In my free time I enjoy learning more about computers and further developing my knowledge in computing. \n
Much of my drive derives from my passion to adventually have a job that I am able to practice these skills in the near future.
