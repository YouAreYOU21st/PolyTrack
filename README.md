# PolyTracks
The objective of this project was to practice team development using Agile Methodologies and an Evolutionary software life cycle development. This game was created with the help of three
other developers as a means to become more proficient and collaborative programmers. Within this game, there are traces of excellent modular object-oriented programming which has allowed us
to build a foundation that is more scaleable for our product's needs. Our process for developing this game was through the use of a Scrum master, Kanban boards, and 3-week sprints. Each sprint
we set out to complete user stories along with documenting our team's progress through the use of burndown charts.

## Game Objective - Instructions
When the user loads into the game, they are greeted with a menu screen to allow them to select the terrain and map size that they would like to play on. After the user has selected a map, the game will begin
in which they are able to generate tracks and store them in the track box. The train will shortly begin spawning after the delay timer goes off, when this happens the user must orient the tracks accordingly to allow the user
to connect the tracks for the train to have a path to reach its destination. During this time the user is also able to use a variety of powerups in the game to such as slowdown, bomb, and freeze. For example, if the user has
run into a situation in which they placed a track in the wrong direction or an obstacle is blocking their direction, the user is able to drag the bomb and destroy the object in their way. The user is able to pause the game
by pressing `ESC` and they can rotate tracks by pressing `r`. After the user has either won or lost the game, they will be prompted with a screen describing their game with a option of `Restart` or `Quit`
